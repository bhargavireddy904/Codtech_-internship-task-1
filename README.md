Over view of the project 

 Project:Program an Arduino board to blink an LED at a specific interval. This project Introduces basic embedded programming concepts and interfacing with hardware.





*Objective:*

Program an Arduino board to blink an LED at a specific interval.



*Key Activities:*



- Write Arduino code to control digital output

- Use the `delay()` function to create a blinking effect

- Connect an LED to a digital pin on the Arduino board

- Upload and run the code on the Arduino board



*Technologies Used:*



- Arduino board (e.g. Arduino Uno)

- LED

- Breadboard and jumper wires

- Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE)



*Key Insights:*



- Understanding of basic Arduino programming syntax and structure

- Introduction to digital output and controlling an LED

- Use of the `delay()` function to create a timing effect

- Familiarity with Arduino IDE and uploading code to the board
